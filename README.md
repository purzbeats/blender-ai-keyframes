Blender Keyframe Exporter for AI Animation

This lets us take audio files and use them as input curves, then use blender's graph editor to massage the curves into exactly the type of animation we want to use!

Select the lane of animation you want to export and run the python script, it spits out the keyframe animation for your project into the Blender System Console.
